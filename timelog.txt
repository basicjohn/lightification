Created a time log for tracking what I'm working on as I build out the project. Watching a Postman livestream as they setup a connection with the philips Hue Bridge and explore the Hue api.
Got a 200 OK response from the bring and continueing to work along with the live stream.

Created a connect with my Hue bridge and able to create a user name through the api.  Next attempting to turn the lights on and off.

Created a PUT request for all lights and a single light.  Next learning how to toggle the light.

Can toggle a selected light now. next learning how to change the colors

timelog_entry_7-16-21_3:26pm
Setup a PUT request to change the settings of a particular light.

timelog_entry_7-16-21_4:32pm
Starting with the open weather api to practice using a second api with the hue Hub

EOD round up

Things I still need to research
Google OAUTH 2.0
Connecting to the Hue Hub remotely because currently it's on the local network.
Integrating it with the google calendar api (I need to research this for a little bit because it might be easier to integrate it now versus later)


New Ideas for functionality
I was thinking about how to make the notifications noticable but also not distracting.
The main goal is so that it is not distracting to your mind but still conveys some sort of information. Having the lights perform at predictable times allows the user to get information fast and cast it out just as fast if it's not useful.
A few solutions that I came up with.
  - having a base on the top of the hour fluctuation/notification for the light. I'm thinking "dun dunnnn dunnnnnnnn" in light form.  Then it would flash a couple light category colors after that. 
  - Having the lights be set to a work day mode.  It gives you a notification at 3 points in the day (start, lunch annd end of the workday) and possibly two more points at set break times.
  
  
  Other app or expanded features for the app
  - pomodoro timer feature. Set the working block time and the breaking block time.  The light is a default color during the working block time and then during the break time it will start at one color and transition to another that way the person can tell how much time is left in the break.

Getting started for the day

timelog_entry_7-17-21_12:34pm
Working on a couple different tutorials right now.
I'm finishing up the tutorial from yesterday which integrates weather with the Hue api.
I'm also working to get OAUTH 2 working in Postman with the Hue api so the app can be configured remotely.

timelog_entry_7-17-21_12:55pm
Ran into an issue where the postman callback URL I had was a deprecated url.  I found the current one and now back on track

timelog_entry_7-17-21_2:25pm
my temp token keeps timing out before I can complete the OAUTH process.  working to get it completed still

timelog_entry_7-17-21_2:39pm
Got the basic OAUTH2 setup.  Working to get a more secure version setup using Nonce.  I should have that finished here shortly.
